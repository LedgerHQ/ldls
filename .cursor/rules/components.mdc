# class-variance-authority (cva)
- Use cva at the top of the file to compose classnames when there is variants composition
- Use cva at the top of the file when there are lots of classnames to declare for a given element
- Otherwise, when there are only few classnames, just set them inline in the JSX part of the component

# Props drill
- Properties of a component should be always be props drilled to the top-level element to avoid any misleading.
- In case of an exception such as passing a nested ref or nested classname, you should consider having different properties names
