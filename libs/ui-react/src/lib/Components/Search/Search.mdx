# 🔍 Search

## Introduction

The Search component is a specialized input field designed specifically for search functionality. It features a built-in search icon, placeholder text, and automatic clear button for enhanced user experience. Unlike regular inputs, it uses placeholder text instead of floating labels for better search UX patterns.

### Search Icon

Fixed 20px search icon positioned on the left with muted color styling.

<Canvas of={SearchStories.Empty} />

### Placeholder Text

Uses placeholder text instead of floating labels for better search UX. Styled with `text-muted` color.

### Clear Button

Appears automatically when input has content. Use `hideClearButton` to hide it or `onClear` for custom behavior.

> **Note:** The clear button only clears the input content/value. It does not clear error states - you must handle error state clearing separately in your component logic.

### Disabled State

### Error State

Supports `aria-invalid` and `errorMessage` props for error handling with proper ARIA labeling.

- Screen reader compatible with accessible labels
- Focus management and error state communication

## Usage

Use Search for search functionality and data querying. Use Input for form data collection.
