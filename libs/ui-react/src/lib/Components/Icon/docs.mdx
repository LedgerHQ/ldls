# üé® Icons

Icons are essential elements that communicate meaning quickly and visually. They support navigation, clarify actions, and enhance the overall user experience. A well-designed icon set ensures clarity, consistency, and scalability across platforms.

## Figma Library

All icons are designed and managed in our Figma Foundations library. This is the single source of truth for our icon set.

## üìè Sizing

Our icons are designed to be scalable and are available in 7 standard sizes to fit various contexts within the UI.

The available sizes are: **16px, 20px, 24px, 32px, 40px, 48px, and 56px**

The thickness of each icon is automatically managed by our token system when you apply a size variable, ensuring visual consistency at any scale.

## Icon Gallery

Here's a preview of all the icons available in our design system. To use an icon, just reference its name.

<IconGallery>
  {/**
   * TODO: We're currently rendering the Spinner icon first because it's not rendered correctly in the gallery for some reason.
   */}
  <IconItem name="Spinner">
    <Icons.Spinner size={24} />
  </IconItem>
  {Object.entries(Icons).map(
    ([name, IconComponent]) =>
      name !== 'Spinner' && (
        <IconItem key={name} name={name}>
          <IconComponent size={24} />
        </IconItem>
      ),
  )}
</IconGallery>
