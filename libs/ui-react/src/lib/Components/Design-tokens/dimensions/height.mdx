# Height

Height tokens are derived from the [size token system](?path=/docs/foundations-dimensions-size--docs) and are used to define the vertical dimensions of elements.

## Usage

Height tokens use the `h-*` prefix followed by the size value. These tokens directly correspond to the size tokens, ensuring consistent vertical dimensions across the design system.

```jsx
<div className="h-32" /> // Sets height to 32px
```

## Implementation

Height tokens are implemented using the same values as size tokens, but with the `h-` prefix instead of `size-`. This means that any size token value can be used as a height value.

### Example Use Cases

- Setting button heights
- Defining line heights
- Controlling image dimensions
- Setting minimum heights for containers
- Defining consistent form input heights

### Best Practices

1. **Use for Fixed Heights**: Height tokens are best used when you need a fixed height that should remain consistent across different contexts.

2. **Consider Responsive Design**: For responsive layouts, consider using relative units or min/max height constraints instead of fixed height tokens.

3. **Maintain Consistency**: Use the same height tokens for similar elements to maintain visual harmony.

4. **Accessibility**: Ensure that using fixed heights doesn't compromise content visibility or readability, especially for text containers.

## Available Values

All height tokens correspond directly to size tokens. For a complete list of available values and their usage, refer to the [Size Tokens documentation](?path=/docs/foundations-dimensions-size--docs#available-values).
