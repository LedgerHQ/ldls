# Spacing

Spacing defines the distance between elements—including margins, paddings, and gaps—to create structure, clarity, and rhythm throughout our interfaces.

## Taxonomy

All spacing tokens follow the structure: `spacing-size`

Example: `spacing-8`

<Markdown>
  {`
| Element  | Definition | Example |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Property | spacing specifies the dimensional values applied as margins, padding, or gaps | spacing |
| Size     | define the value | 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40 |
`}
</Markdown>
