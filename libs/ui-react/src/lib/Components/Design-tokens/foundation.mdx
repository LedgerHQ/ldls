# Foundation

**Design tokens are variables that contain all the foundations with the design values needed to build a scalable Design Language System**

Design tokens are small, reusable design decisions that replace static values with self-explanatory names, storing design-related values—such as color, typography, spacing, and other UI properties—in a design system to ensure consistency, scalability, and a unified visual style across different platforms and technologies.

## Figma Library

Here is the Figma library Link: [Figma Library](https://www.figma.com/design/1234567890/Design-Tokens?node-id=1234567890%3A1234567890)

### Primitives Tokens

A primitive token is an agnostic token that is not tied to a meaning or usage. These tokens are used to enumerate all the parameters available for design systems. These can be hexadecimal, spacings, fonts, size fonts, etc...

Ex: `color-light-purple050`

### Semantic Tokens

A semantic token is an specific token tied to a particular use case. Specific tokens are derived from primitive tokens but are explicitly defined for a particular UI element, ensuring a more tailored design while still maintaining consistency across the system.

Ex: `background-accent`

## Tokens Structure

Design tokens follow a nested structure. All semantic tokens are constructed from a primitive, which in turn is constructed from a raw value. This structured approach ensures scalability, consistency, and flexibility, making it easier to manage and update design systems efficiently.

## Tokens Level

The hierarchy of tokens is categorized into four levels: Primitives, Theme, Brand, Breakpoint, and Icon

**1.Primitives** are the foundational, agnostic tokens that define core design parameters such as colors, typography, and spacing. These tokens are neutral and not tied to a specific usage.

**2.Theme** tokens are semantic tokens that enable switching between light and dark themes, while maintaining consistency across components.

**3.Brand** tokens introduce brand-specific styling, allowing components to adapt their design based on different brand identities while still being linked to the primitive tokens.

**4.Breakpoint** tokens help adjust component behaviour based on screen sizes, ensuring responsive design by defining how elements should adapt across different devices.

**5.Icon** tokens allow allow to adjust icon ui regarding its size.

This structure makes design systems flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain, allowing UI elements to be customised dynamically without altering the underlying primitives.
