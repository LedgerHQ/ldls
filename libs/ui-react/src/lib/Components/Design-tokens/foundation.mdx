# üèóÔ∏è Foundation

**Design tokens are variables that contain all the foundations with the design values needed to build a scalable Design Language System**

Design tokens are small, reusable design decisions that replace static values with self-explanatory names, storing design-related values‚Äîsuch as color, typography, spacing, and other UI properties‚Äîin a design system to ensure consistency, scalability, and a unified visual style across different platforms and technologies.

## üé® Design Tokens

### Figma Library

Here is the Figma library Link: [Figma Library](https://www.figma.com/design/OfWotFqWbBVlNu7v0VaKha/0.Foundations-Library?node-id=2281-610&m=dev)

### Primitives Tokens

A primitive token is an agnostic token that is not tied to a meaning or usage. These tokens are used to enumerate all the parameters available for design systems. These can be hexadecimal, spacings, fonts, size fonts, etc...

Example: `color-light-purple-050`

**These tokens are used under the hood as CSS variables** by the `@ldls/design-core` library (e.g., `var(--color-light-purple-050)`) and **should not be used directly by developers**. They serve as the foundation for semantic tokens.

### Semantic Tokens

A semantic token is a specific token tied to a particular use case. Specific tokens are derived from primitive tokens but are explicitly defined for a particular UI element, ensuring a more tailored design while still maintaining consistency across the system.

Example: `background-accent`

**These are the tokens developers should use** as Tailwind utility classes in their applications (e.g., `bg-accent`, `text-on-accent`, `border-muted`).

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Usage

**‚úÖ DO: Use Semantic Tokens**

- Use Tailwind utility classes like `bg-accent`, `text-on-accent`, `p-16`, `rounded-md`
- These map to semantic tokens and provide meaningful, context-aware styling
- Example: `<div className="bg-accent text-on-accent p-16 rounded-md">Content</div>`

**‚ùå DON'T: Use Primitive Tokens**

- Avoid using CSS variables directly like `var(--color-light-purple-050)` or `var(--spacing-16)`
- These are implementation details managed by the design system
- They may change without notice and don't provide semantic meaning

**Why this matters:**

- Semantic tokens ensure your UI adapts correctly to theme changes (light/dark mode)
- They provide consistent behavior across different brand contexts
- They're easier to understand and maintain in your codebase

## ‚ö° Token Structure

Design tokens follow a nested structure. All semantic tokens are constructed from a primitive, which in turn is constructed from a raw value. This structured approach ensures scalability, consistency, and flexibility, making it easier to manage and update design systems efficiently.

## üìä Token Levels

<img src={tokenLevels} alt="Token levels diagram" />

The hierarchy of tokens is categorized into five key levels:

**1. Primitives** are the foundational, agnostic tokens that define core design parameters such as colors, typography, and spacing. These tokens are neutral and not tied to a specific usage.

**2. Theme** tokens enable switching between light and dark themes, while maintaining consistency across components.

**3. Brand** tokens introduce brand-specific styling, allowing components to adapt their design based on different brand identities.

**4. Breakpoint** tokens help adjust component behaviour based on screen sizes, ensuring responsive design.

**5. Icon** tokens allow adjustment of icon UI regarding its size.

This structure makes design systems flexible, scalable, and easy to maintain, allowing UI elements to be customized dynamically without altering the underlying primitives.
