# Button Component

Welcome to the documentation for the `Button` component. Buttons are a fundamental part of any user interface,
allowing users to take actions and make choices with a single tap or click.

Our `Button` component is designed to be versatile, accessible, and easy to integrate. It supports various styles (variants) and sizes to fit different contexts within your application.

## Variants and Sizes

Below are examples of the primary and secondary button variants, showcased in different sizes.

### Primary Buttons

Primary buttons are used for the main call to action on a page.

The `Button` component is essential for all user interactions requiring an action.
It is available in several variants and sizes.

**Example of a Primary Button:**

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
</Canvas>

**Example of a Secondary Button:**

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
</Canvas>
