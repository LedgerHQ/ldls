# 🔘 Button

## Introduction

Buttons are key interactive elements that trigger actions and guide users through the interface. They come in various styles and states to reflect hierarchy, intent, and context.

## Anatomy

- **Label**: describes the action that occurs when the button is tapped
- **Icon (optional)**: visually communicate the button's action, and helps draw attention

## Properties

### Overview

### Content

Buttons' contents can be of three types:

- text (default)
- icon-text
- icon

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.ContentTypesShowcase} />

> Note: Buttons of the smallest size XS can't have a label, so they default to an icon only.

### Size

Buttons come in four different sizes:

- XS (**32 px** tall) **[ICON ONLY]**
- S (**44 px** tall)
- M (default, **48 px** tall)
- L (**56 px** tall)

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.SizesShowcase} />

> **⚠️ Important**: Icon sizes are automatically managed by the Button component based on the selected size. Never override the icon size using className or style props, as this will break the visual consistency of the design system. The Button component ensures proper scaling and alignment of icons across all sizes.
>
> ```tsx
> // ✅ Correct: Let Button handle icon sizing
> <Button size="xs" icon={Settings} aria-label="Settings" />
>
> // ❌ Wrong: Don't override icon size [it's not gonna work even if you try]
> <Button size="xs" icon={Settings} className="w-6 h-6" aria-label="Settings" />
> ```

### States

## Responsive Layout

Buttons dynamically adapt their width to the size of their content, while keeping the default paddings:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.ResponsiveLayout} />

When a label is too long, it's truncated to 2 lines, with a maximum width of the button's container:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.ResponsiveLayout2} />

> The Button must dynamically resize to its container constraints.

## Accessibility

To be implemented:

- Color contrast
- Text zoom
- Keyboard navigation
- Semantic labeling
