## Introduction

Spots are circular status indicators that provide visual feedback about different states, actions, or information. They come in various predefined appearances and can display custom icons or numbers to convey specific meanings in the interface.

### States

The Spot component has an optional disabled state.

<Canvas of={SpotStories.StatesShowcase} />

### Discriminated Union Types

The Spot component uses TypeScript's discriminated union pattern to ensure type safety:

- `appearance: 'icon'` requires an `icon` prop
- `appearance: 'number'` requires a `number` prop (0-9)
- All other appearances are self-contained

## Accessibility

To be implemented:

- Color contrast verification
- Screen reader support for status descriptions
- Keyboard navigation considerations
- Semantic labeling for different states
