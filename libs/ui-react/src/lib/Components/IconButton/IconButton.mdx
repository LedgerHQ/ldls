# üéØ IconButton

## Introduction

IconButtons are specialized interactive elements designed exclusively for icon-based actions. They provide a compact way to trigger actions while maintaining clear visual hierarchy through two distinct styles optimized for different icon types.

### Icon Types

IconButtons come in two visual styles, each optimized for specific use cases:

- **filled**: Best for filled/solid icons. Features a transparent background with colored icon that changes on interaction
- **stroked**: Best for outlined icons. Features a subtle background that appears on hover with colored icon states

### Icon Sizes

IconButtons support various icon sizes to accommodate different use cases and screen densities:

Common sizes include:

- **16px**: Compact actions in dense interfaces
- **20px**: Standard size for most icon buttons
- **24px**: Prominent actions in toolbars
- **40px**: Large touch targets for mobile interfaces

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Icon sizes are controlled by the icon component itself, not through CSS classes. Always use the `size` prop on your icon component (e.g., `<Settings size={20} />`) to ensure proper scaling and visual consistency.

### Icon States

IconButtons have enabled or disabled states:

## Accessibility

IconButtons require special attention for accessibility since they contain only visual icons without text:

### Screen Reader Support

**Always provide an `aria-label` prop** that clearly describes the button's action:

```tsx
<IconButton iconType="filled" aria-label="Delete item">
  <DeleteCircleFill size={20} />
</IconButton>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

IconButtons support full keyboard navigation:

- **Tab**: Moves focus to the button
- **Enter/Space**: Activates the button
- **Focus ring**: Visible outline for keyboard users
