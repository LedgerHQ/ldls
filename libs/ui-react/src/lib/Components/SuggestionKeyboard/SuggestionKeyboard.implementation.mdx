# SuggestionKeyboard Component Implementation

## Installation

Install the packages and their peer dependencies:

```bash
# Install the UI Kit
npm install @ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react @ledgerhq/ldls-design-core

# Install peer dependencies
npm install tailwindcss@^3.4.0 react@^18.3.1 clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority
```

### Tailwind Configuration

To use the SuggestionKeyboard component with our custom Tailwind preset, you need to configure your `tailwind.config.ts`:

```typescript
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';
import { ledgerLivePreset } from '@ledgerhq/ldls-design-core';

const config = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // Your project's files
    "./node_modules/@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react/dist/lib/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}" // Ledger UI Kit components
  ],
  presets: [ledgerLivePreset], // the installed tailwind preset
} satisfies Config;

export default config;
```

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import {
  SuggestionKeyboard,
  SuggestionKeyboardItem,
} from '@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <SuggestionKeyboard>
      <SuggestionKeyboardItem>25%</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      <SuggestionKeyboardItem>50%</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      <SuggestionKeyboardItem>75%</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      <SuggestionKeyboardItem>Max</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
    </SuggestionKeyboard>
  );
}
```

### With Disabled Suggestions

Individual suggestion items can be disabled:

```tsx
import {
  SuggestionKeyboard,
  SuggestionKeyboardItem,
} from '@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <SuggestionKeyboard>
      <SuggestionKeyboardItem>50$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      <SuggestionKeyboardItem>100$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      <SuggestionKeyboardItem disabled>250$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      <SuggestionKeyboardItem disabled>500$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
    </SuggestionKeyboard>
  );
}
```

### Layout Variations

The SuggestionKeyboard uses flexbox for layout. By default, items are spaced evenly with `justify-between`. You can customize the layout using Tailwind classes:

```tsx
import {
  SuggestionKeyboard,
  SuggestionKeyboardItem,
} from '@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react';

function LayoutExample() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Default: Space Between */}
      <SuggestionKeyboard>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>250$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>500$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>1000$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      </SuggestionKeyboard>

      {/* Centered with custom gap */}
      <SuggestionKeyboard className="justify-center gap-24">
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>250$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>500$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>1000$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      </SuggestionKeyboard>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Arbitrary Numbers of Suggestions

The component supports an arbitrary number of suggestion items, but more than 4 may require custom styling for optimal display:

```tsx
import {
  SuggestionKeyboard,
  SuggestionKeyboardItem,
} from '@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react';

function CountExample() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* 2 Suggestions */}
      <SuggestionKeyboard>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>500$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>1000$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      </SuggestionKeyboard>

      {/* 3 Suggestions */}
      <SuggestionKeyboard>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>250$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>500$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>1000$</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      </SuggestionKeyboard>

      {/* 4 Suggestions */}
      <SuggestionKeyboard>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>25%</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>50%</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>75%</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
        <SuggestionKeyboardItem>Max</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
      </SuggestionKeyboard>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Do's and Don'ts

The following guidelines ensure consistent usage of the SuggestionKeyboard component and maintain design system principles.

### Content Composition

✅ **Do**

```tsx
// Use SuggestionKeyboardItem as children
<SuggestionKeyboard>
  <SuggestionKeyboardItem>25%</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
  <SuggestionKeyboardItem>50%</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
</SuggestionKeyboard>

// Add event handlers to items
<SuggestionKeyboardItem onClick={handleClick}>Max</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
```

❌ **Don't**

```tsx
// Don't use plain buttons or divs as children
<SuggestionKeyboard>
  <button>25%</button>
  <button>50%</button>
</SuggestionKeyboard>

// Don't nest complex components inside items
<SuggestionKeyboardItem>
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <Icon /> Max
  </div>
</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
```

### Layout and Styling

✅ **Do**

```tsx
// Use className for layout adjustments
<SuggestionKeyboard className="justify-center gap-16">
  ...
</SuggestionKeyboard>

// Use container elements for positioning
<div className="w-full px-24">
  <SuggestionKeyboard>...</SuggestionKeyboard>
</div>

// Use for responsive layouts
<SuggestionKeyboard className="flex-col md:flex-row">
  ...
</SuggestionKeyboard>
```

❌ **Don't**

```tsx
// Don't override item styling directly
<SuggestionKeyboard className="bg-accent">
  ...
</SuggestionKeyboard>

// Don't modify internal padding of items
<SuggestionKeyboardItem className="px-4 py-2">...</SuggestionKeyboardItem>

// Don't override typography
<SuggestionKeyboardItem className="body-1-semi-bold">...</SuggestionKeyboardItem>
```

> **Note**: Use `className` primarily for flexbox layout properties (justify, gap, etc.). The individual item styling (colors, padding, hover states) should remain consistent with the design system.
