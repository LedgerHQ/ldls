# AddressFieldInput

The AddressFieldInput component provides a specialized input field for entering cryptocurrency addresses or ENS names. Built on top of BaseInput, it features a customizable prefix label (defaults to "To:") and context-aware suffix icons.

> **Layout:** The AddressFieldInput component takes the full width of its container by default. You can control the width directly using `containerClassName` or by wrapping in a container.

## Introduction

AddressFieldInput is designed specifically where users need to enter wallet addresses or ENS names. It combines the reliability of BaseInput with domain-specific UX enhancements:

- **Customizable prefix label** - defaults to "To:" but can be overridden via prefix prop
- **IconButton QR code scanner** - Easy address scanning when empty using consistent IconButton styling
- **Smart clear button** - Appears automatically when content is entered
- **ENS support** - Placeholder indicates support for both address formats
- **Full validation support** - Complete error handling and state management

## Properties

<Controls />

## States

### Empty State

Shows the IconButton QR code scanner, indicating users can scan addresses directly.

<Canvas of={AddressFieldInputStories.Empty} />

### With Content

When an address is entered, the QR code icon is replaced with a clear button for easy content removal.

<Canvas of={AddressFieldInputStories.WithContent} />

### Disabled State

Prevents interaction while maintaining visual consistency.

<Canvas of={AddressFieldInputStories.Disabled} />

### Error State

Displays validation errors with proper ARIA attributes for accessibility.

<Canvas of={AddressFieldInputStories.Error} />

## Clear Button

The clear button automatically appears when content is entered, allowing users to quickly reset the field. The QR code scanner icon returns when the field becomes empty.

> **Note:** The clear button only clears the input content/value. It does not clear error states - you must handle error state clearing separately in your component logic.

## Accessibility

- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for screen readers
- **Error States**: Full ARIA support for validation messages
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
