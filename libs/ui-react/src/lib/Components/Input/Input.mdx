# ⌨️ Input

## Introduction

Input fields are essential form elements that enable users to enter and edit text. This component features a floating label, error states, and an automatic clear button for enhanced user experience.
It also provides the ability to add custom elements on the right side of the input.

## Anatomy

<Canvas of={InputStories.Default} />
<Controls of={InputStories.Default} />

> **Layout:** The Input component takes the full width of its container by default. You can control the width directly using `containerClassName` or by wrapping in a container.

### Clear Button

A clear button (×) appears **automatically** when input has content.

> **Note:** The clear button only clears the input content/value. It does not clear error states - you must handle error state clearing separately in your component logic.

<Canvas of={InputStories.WithContent} />

> **Note:** The clear button only clears the input content/value. It does not clear error states - you must handle error state clearing separately in your component logic.

#### **Hiding the Clear Button**

Use `hideClearButton` to prevent the clear button from appearing:

<Canvas of={InputStories.HiddenClearButton} />

#### **Extending the Clear Behavior**

Use `onClear` to extend the default clear behavior with custom logic:

<Canvas of={InputStories.ExtendedClearBehavior} />

### Error State

The input supports error handling through:

- `aria-invalid`: Controls the error state styling
- `errorMessage`: Displays an error message below the input
- Error styling includes a red ring and text color

<Canvas of={InputStories.WithError} />

The error message will be automatically:

- Connected to the input using aria-describedby
- Displayed with a warning icon
- Styled in the error color
- Announced by screen readers

### Custom Right Element

The input supports custom interactive elements on the right side through the `suffix` prop:

<Canvas of={InputStories.WithCustomElement} />

You can add: Tooltips, Action buttons, Custom icons, Any interactive element

> **Important note:** The clear button automatically appears when input has content and will take priority over your `suffix`. Use `hideClearButton` to prevent this if you need persistent right-side content.

### Interactive in a Form

## Input Types

The component supports various HTML input types:

- text (default)
- email
- password
- number
- tel
- url

## Accessibility

The Input component follows accessibility best practices:

- Uses semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes
- Supports keyboard navigation
- Labels are properly associated with inputs using htmlFor
- Error messages are linked to inputs using aria-describedby
- Clear button has an accessible label
- Error states are communicated through aria-invalid

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

The Input component supports both controlled and uncontrolled usage:

### Uncontrolled (with defaultValue)

<Canvas of={InputStories.UncontrolledInputExample} />

### Controlled (with value and onChange)

<Canvas of={InputStories.ControlledInputExample} />

## Label vs Placeholder

> ⚠️ **Important:** Do not combine `label` and `placeholder` props together. They will visually overlap and create a poor user experience.

The Input component uses **floating labels** that animate from inside the input field. Using both label and placeholder simultaneously will cause them to overlap and interfere with each other.

## Best Practices

**Labels**: Always provide clear, descriptive labels

**Error Messages**: Make error messages helpful and actionable

**Validation**: Validate on blur or submit, not on every keystroke

**Clear Button**: Use for optional fields where clearing is helpful

**Types**: Use the appropriate input type for the data being collected

**Label vs Placeholder**: Choose one approach - don't mix floating labels with placeholders
