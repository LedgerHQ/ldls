<Meta title="Getting Started/Quick Start" />

## 🚀 Quick Start

1 . Configure Tailwind:
See our [Tailwind Setup Guide](/docs/tailwind-setup-guide--docs) and [Tailwind Configuration](/docs/tailwind-configuration--docs) for more information.

2 . Install `ui-react` package:

Install the package:

```bash
npm install @ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react
```

And its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority
```

3 . Start using components:

```bash
# Install peer dependency related to the button component
npm install @radix-ui/react-slot
```

`@radix-ui/react-slot`: This dependency is used internally by the Button component to enable flexible composition patterns. It allows the Button to merge its props with child elements when needed.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button appearance="base">
      Get Started
    </Button>
  );
}
```
