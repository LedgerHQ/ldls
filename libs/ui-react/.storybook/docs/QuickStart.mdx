## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📦 Available Packages

Our design system is available as npm packages:

- **[@ledgerhq/ldls-design-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/ldls-design-core)** - Design tokens, themes, and core utilities all in one tailwind preset.
- **[@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react)** - React components built with Tailwind CSS V3 and Radix UI primitives.
- **[@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-rnative](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-rnative)** - React Native components built with NativeWind.

### 🛠️ Setup Steps

1 . Configure Tailwind:
See our [Setup Tailwind](?path=/docs/getting-started-setup-tailwind--docs) guide for complete setup instructions.

2 . Install `ldls-ui-react` package:

Install the package:

```bash
npm install @ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react
```

And its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority
```

3 . Start using components:

```bash
# Install peer dependency related to the button component
npm install @radix-ui/react-slot
```

`@radix-ui/react-slot`: This dependency is used internally by the Button component to enable flexible composition patterns. It allows the Button to merge its props with child elements when needed.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@ledgerhq/ldls-ui-react';

function App() {
  return <Button appearance='base'>Get Started</Button>;
}
```
